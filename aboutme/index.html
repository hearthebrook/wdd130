        <p class="pink"> Hello! I'm Brooklynn Hathaway and this is my first semester back from my mission to Bakersfield CA. However I 
            did do a few semesters before I left. I'm currently a software engineering major (but it's likely to change). My dream job would
            be to work in the cyber security industry in some way. I absolutely love the stories about penetration testing and would love to 
            give that a try! I would strongly recommend the Darknet Diaries podcast if you want some good stories about pen testing and hacking! </p>
        <p class="pink"> On top of this I also really enjoy music! I play the french horn, trumpet, piano, and ukulele. I love playing all of them and I love 
            writing and arranging music even though I'm not too experienced :/  When I'm not doing this I'm typically with my family hanging out 
            with my 4 younger brothers! That's who's in the picture :)</p>
        <p class="pink"> If you ever really get talking to me you'll learn I have many interests and love learning just about anything! That's what I love about 
            BYU-I and specifically about the programming classes here, you get a lot of freedom in what you learn about and create! </p>
